Glad you did. Hey, thanks for downloading my second pack of
tilesets for RPG Maker VX and VX Ace.

This is the work I've developed in the summer of 2012. It
contains some tilesets made from zero, some edits from other
authors and mixes from various sources. This was done with
the best of the intentions, so please respect all the people
that contributed to this pack. Thanks.

I don't believe in credits, so... but if you want to use
these in a commercial game, please send me an e-mail to
